At the same time, it also attracts investors from all over the world to invest in Shenzhen, making Shenzhen's product technology, management level, and national taxation the most prosperous period. Shenzhen is the capital of entrepreneurship. It can also be said that Shenzhen is the best entrepreneurial city in the country. Shenzhen not only gave birth to famous enterprises like Tencent and Huawei, but also gave birth to many entrepreneurs of small and medium-sized private enterprises. A city developed by Hong Kong’s geographical advantages, that is to say, without Hong Kong, there would be no current Shenzhen. Shenzhen is now a brand new city.
